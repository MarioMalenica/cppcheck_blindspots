cppcheck_test.c:42:20: Function fgets expects arg 2 to be int gets arbitrary
                          unsigned integral type: sizeof((text)) - 1
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match any integral type, use
  +matchanyintegral.
cppcheck_test.c:42:2: Called procedure fgets may access global errno
  A checked global variable is used in the function, but not listed in its
  globals clause. By default, only globals specified in .lcl files are checked.
  To check all globals, use +allglobals. To check globals selectively use
  /*@checked@*/ in the global declaration. (Use -globs to inhibit warning)
cppcheck_test.c:42:32: Possibly null storage fp passed as non-null param:
                          fgets (..., fp)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   cppcheck_test.c:38:7: Storage fp may become null
cppcheck_test.c:42:2: Return value (type char *) ignored: fgets(text, size...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)
cppcheck_test.c:46:2: Called procedure fclose may access global errno
cppcheck_test.c:46:2: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(fp)
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)

cppcheck_test.c:72:2: Statement has no effect: (void)prev_entry
  Statement has no visible effect --- no values are modified. (Use -noeffect to
  inhibit warning)
cppcheck_test.c:83:8: Called procedure opendir may access global errno
cppcheck_test.c:86:20: Possibly null storage dir passed as non-null param:
                          readdir_r (dir, ...)
   cppcheck_test.c:83:8: Storage dir may become null
cppcheck_test.c:86:9: Suspected infinite loop.  No condition values modified. 
    Modification possible through unconstrained calls: readdir_r
  This appears to be an infinite loop. Nothing in the body of the loop or the
  loop test modifies the value of the loop test. There may be a modification
  through a call to an unconstrained function, or an unconstrained function in
  the loop test may use a global variable modified by the loop body. (Use
  -infloopsuncon to inhibit warning)
cppcheck_test.c:91:2: Called procedure closedir may access global errno
cppcheck_test.c:91:2: Return value (type int) ignored: closedir(dir)
cppcheck_test.c:106:30: Initializer block for test_arr has 3 elements, but
  declared as char * [4]: "abc", "def", "ghi"                             
  		"jkl"
  Initializer does not define all elements of a declared array. (Use
  -initallelements to inhibit warning)
cppcheck_test.c:107:3: Read-only string literal storage used as initial value
                          for unqualified storage: test_arr[0] = "abc"
  A read-only string literal is assigned to a non-observer reference. (Use
  -readonlytrans to inhibit warning)
cppcheck_test.c:108:3: Read-only string literal storage used as initial value
                          for unqualified storage: test_arr[1] = "def"
cppcheck_test.c:109:3: Read-only string literal storage used as initial value

cppcheck_test.c:158:9: Stack-allocated storage ptr reachable from return value:
                          ptr
  A stack reference is pointed to by an external reference when the function
  returns. The stack-allocated storage is destroyed after the call, leaving a
  dangling reference. (Use -stackref to inhibit warning)
   cppcheck_test.c:154:2: Storage ptr becomes stack-allocated storage

  A memory leak has been detected. Storage allocated locally is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreefresh to inhibit
